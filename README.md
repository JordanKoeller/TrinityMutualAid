# TrinityMutualAid
Code for [TrinityMutualAid's website](http://trinitymutualaid.com)

# Website Desires

  + An about page (TMA, what we do, who our fiscal sponsorship is, our guidelines) this will hopefully be the launch/home page
  + Requesting Aid
  + DONATE! (prompt for recurring monthly)
  + Annual Report
  + Resources and other orgs
  + News and events
  + Contact us

## Functional Considerations

  + Super easy to navigate to donate and request aid.
  + Simplicity is desired, especially in navigation.


## Style Considerations

  + [Html5up Verti](https://html5up.net/verti) a good functional example, but too much whitespace.
  + [Esperanzacenter.org](https://eperanzacenter.org) has good aesthetic, but ideally more 
  + intersectionalenvironmentalist.com has a nice layout, but a little flashy.
  + Two other sources: [Wix](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2963?siteId=742f7fa4-3f82-4f7d-9c24-1e08aad8420c&metaSiteId=2fd910c7-f506-4742-8c1d-c53470db7560&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fall%2F2&tpClick=view_button) is nice, and then [chrpartners.org](https://chrpartners.org) is nice.

## My thoughts

It's important that what I design work in a fairly hands-off way. Meaning, other people can edit it directly without having to go through me.

With that in mind, I view my job more as one of setting up a framework and tools for you all to use to fill in the website with content.

## Notes:

Easy to navigate
Esperanza center -> less to promote.

Transactions -> Venmo (Megan contact for more info.)
## Paypal for transactions
## Recurring donor option

## Requesting aid
  Submit a form (google forms in the past)

## Visuals
  Option to donate on every page -> Button locked to the top.

## Annual report -> PDF so not a lot to do there.

# NO E AT THE END

Bank account info -> once we have a credit card can take off. So I'll wait on that before setting up anything permanent.

Wed > Money situation and writing content.

# Todo List:
1. Make sure that JSON uploads properly scrape out the dataUrl on file upload. DONE
2. Fix issue where adding a block stops from being able to change fonts on that block. DONE
3. Create accounts for TMA people
4. Clean up uploads in the s3 buckets, as well as tests so it doesn't make a bunch of dummy data for tests that aren't cleaned up.

Code for TrinityMutualAide's website

# Website Desires

  + An about page (TMA, what we do, who our fiscal sponsorship is, our guidelines) this will hopefully be the launch/home page
  + Requesting Aid
  + DONATE! (prompt for recurring monthly)
  + Annual Report
  + Resources and other orgs
  + News and events
  + Contact us

## Functional Considerations

  + Super easy to navigate to donate and request aid.
  + Simplicity is desired, especially in navigation.


## Style Considerations

  + [Html5up Verti](https://html5up.net/verti) a good functional example, but too much whitespace.
  + [Esperanzacenter.org](https://eperanzacenter.org) has good aesthetic, but ideally more 
  + intersectionalenvironmentalist.com has a nice layout, but a little flashy.
  + Two other sources: [Wix](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2963?siteId=742f7fa4-3f82-4f7d-9c24-1e08aad8420c&metaSiteId=2fd910c7-f506-4742-8c1d-c53470db7560&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fall%2F2&tpClick=view_button) is nice, and then [chrpartners.org](https://chrpartners.org) is nice.

## My thoughts

It's important that what I design work in a fairly hands-off way. Meaning, other people can edit it directly without having to go through me.

With that in mind, I view my job more as one of setting up a framework and tools for you all to use to fill in the website with content.

## Notes:

Easy to navigate
Esperanza center -> less to promote.

Transactions -> Venmo (Megan contact for more info.)
## Paypal for transactions
## Recurring donor option

## Requesting aid
  Submit a form (google forms in the past)

## Visuals
  Option to donate on every page -> Button locked to the top.

## Annual report -> PDF so not a lot to do there.

# NO E AT THE END

Bank account info -> once we have a credit card can take off. So I'll wait on that before setting up anything permanent.

Wed > Money situation and writing content.

# Todo List:
1. Image upload resizing -- Done
2. Image autopopulation between english/spanish -- Done
3. Article IDs for the Home Page/FAQs/Anything else to migrate.

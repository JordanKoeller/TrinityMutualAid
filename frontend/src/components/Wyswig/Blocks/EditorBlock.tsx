/**
 * 
 * I kind of hate Facebook's interfaces/apis for Draft.js. So I'm just going to wrap it in one that makes sense to me.
 * 
 * I get it's flexible and extensible, and maybe for extremely advanced editors that flexibility is good. But I don't need it.
 * 
 * To make a Block editor, you just make a subclass of the class below. A "Block" is a section of vertical space on the screen,
 * or an otherwise discrete section of a document. The ones that exist right now are for a paragraph, a Splitpanel with an image
 *   on one side and text on the other, and then finally, a news card.
